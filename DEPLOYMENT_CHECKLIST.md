## Security Notes

### Production Firestore Rules
Ensure rules are restrictive:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Battles are public but creation requires auth
    match /battles/{battleId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create, update: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Storage Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /users/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /public/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
